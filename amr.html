                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>5. Data Processing and Analysis : </b>Upon receiving meter data, the central server or cloud
                        platform processes and analyzes the information to generate bills, monitor consumption trends,
                        and identify anomalies or irregularities. Advanced analytics algorithms may be employed to
                        identify potential leaks, predict future consumption patterns, or optimize resource allocation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>6. Billing and Reporting : </b>Based on the processed data, utilities providers generate
                        bills for consumers, ensuring accurate billing based on actual consumption. Consumers may also
                        access their consumption data through web portals or mobile applications, allowing them to track
                        their usage, set alerts for abnormal consumption, or adjust their behavior to reduce energy
                        consumption.
                    </p>
                </div>
